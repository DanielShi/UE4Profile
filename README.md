# UE4Profile
At this moment, there is no book for the technique detail of UE4. We'd like to contribute our effert to profile UE4 and analyze its core technique. By doing this, we are able to have a better understanding of UE4 and learn amazing technology from it.

In This book, we are not going to discuss how to use UE4. Instead, we focus on how it is implemented. 

We use reStructedText as the composing language.
Our goal is to go deeper and deeper. It may not cover everything of this engine. But for the aspect it covers, we are trying to make it as clear as possible.
